<h2 id="the-reasons-to-use-everbee" class="wp-block-heading">The Reasons To Use Everbee</h2>
<p><strong>Saves time and money</strong> – Everbee is a tool that helps me confirm whether or not a potential product idea is worth pursuing. This way, I don’t waste time and money creating products that won’t sell.</p>
<p><strong>Helps with product research</strong> – Everbee gives me in-depth product research in no time. I can see what products are in high demand, what’s working, and what’s not.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to use </strong>– Everbee is super easy to use, and the customer support team is amazing. They have helpful tutorial videos and are always available to answer any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Helps create best-selling items</strong> – Everbee shows me exactly what products are best-selling, which gives me ideas for new products to create. This way, I can stay ahead of the competition and bring in more sales.</p>
<p><strong>Gives tag ideas</strong> – Everbee shows me the tags that the top listings are using, which gives me ideas for tags to apply to my own listings for better visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Connects with my shop</strong> – Everbee needs to connect with my Etsy shop in order to provide accurate data. It doesn’t have access to my personal or shop information, and I can revoke access at any time.</p>
<h2 id="everbee-keyword-research-tool" class="wp-block-heading">EverBee Keyword Research Tool</h2>
<p>The keyword research tool allows users to search for a particular term to get an indication of the number of searches, competition, and demand trends.</p>
<p>Below you will see the result of a search for Mountain Bike Hoodie carried out in eRank and Everbee.</p>
<p>The total search volume differs from 134 average from eRank compared to 20 in Everbee. The competition stats are very similar though (1069 erank vs 1172 everbee).</p>

<p>As you can see from the above, the amount of data that you get from eRank is far more in-depth. But whether you need all that information is down to personal preference.</p>
<p>Everbee provides product and market research tool that helps users find products to sell, and so Keyword research isn’t core to its offering.</p>
<h2 id="everbee-product-analytics-tool" class="wp-block-heading">EverBee Product Analytics Tool</h2>

<p>The data provided, even on the free option can provide insights for your Etsy business on what items may be selling and in the highest demand. This way you can focus your energy on creating products to ride the trend and optimize your own listings based on your findings.</p>
<h3 id="game-changing-email-tool" class="wp-block-heading">Game Changing Email Tool</h3>
<p>Late 2023 Everbee added a new feature Everbee Email. Everbee Etsy email has two key elements.</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
	<li>Send automated emails on your behalf for Order Confirmation, Shipping Confirmation, Delivery Confirmation, and Review request.</li>
	<li>Build an email list and send newsletters to your subscribers.</li>

<p>You get to create your own templates with your own branding.</p>
<p>You also get an email list sign-up page.</p>
<p>Given that Etsy owns your customer data and Etsy also has the habit of shutting down shops with no warning, having the ability to contact your customers directly is great.</p>
<p>The Everbee Email functionality works well, it’s easy to set up and it comes included in the monthly charge. (with usage limits)</p>

<h2 id="is-everbee-accurate" class="wp-block-heading">Is EverBee Accurate?</h2>
<p>When I first tested Everbee I wasn’t convinced by their results. However, Everbee has updated its algorithms and Im pleased to say the data is far better. (and it performs better than Alura)</p>
<h3 id="keyword-search-volume--competition-data" class="wp-block-heading">Keyword Search Volume &amp; Competition Data</h3>
<p>As you can see from the images in the Keyword research section above the data that Everbee provides is a little different from that of eRank. eRank shows an average of 200 per month (peaks at 1200 per month down to 10 per month) whereas EverBee just states &lt;20 per month.</p>
<p>The number of competitors is different too. 981 in eRank to 1172 in Everbee.</p>
<p>Having sold many Mountain Bike Hoodies I know that the trend chart in eRank is more accurate with a peak leading up to summer and a larger peak in the lead-up to Xmas.</p>
<p>One thing I like about Everbee is that it gives an<strong> Everbee keyword score</strong> to highlight the low competition high search keywords.</p>
<h3 id="everbee-sales-and-revenue-data" class="wp-block-heading">Everbee Sales and Revenue Data</h3>
<p>EverBee uses its estimated sales algorithm to show you what an existing Etsy shop or Etsy listing is earning in revenue. It also estimates the number of sales.</p>
<p><strong>I tested the accuracy</strong> of the tool by looking at the stats provided by Everbee for one of my own listings (see below).</p>
<div class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image1876_460b63-d7">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://www.everbee.io/?via=87OFF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="kb-img wp-image-3774" src="https://chrismjackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Everbee_listing_analysis-1.webp" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" srcset="https://chrismjackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Everbee_listing_analysis-1.webp 500w, https://chrismjackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Everbee_listing_analysis-1-220x300.webp 220w" alt="" width="500" height="682" /></a></figure>
</div>
<p>Everbee shows the item has sold 64 times.</p>
<p>The item has sold 65 times. Thats close enough for me.</p>
<p>I ran the same test with the same listing (on the same day) with Alura. Alura estimated the item had sold 73 times.</p>
<p>So in this simple test, Everbee was more accurate than Alura.</p>
<div class="wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn kb-buttons-wrap kb-btns1876_7f7c90-53"><span class="kt-btn-inner-text">Find Top Selling Products with Everbee</span></div>
<p>I repeated the test with another two listings and found <strong>Everbee was far more accurate than Alura.</strong></p>
<p>Given that Etsy doesn’t provide sales data via its API, it’s great to see that Everbee have found a way of providing pretty accurate sales data.</p>
<h2 id="is-everbee-worth-it" class="wp-block-heading">Is Everbee Worth It?</h2>
<p>I would use EverBee alongside an Etsy SEO tool like eRank or Marmalead as it doesn’t give me the detailed keyword data to help with keyword ideas and optimizing my listings.</p>
<p>However, that’s because I prefer data rather than searching through Etsy using a Chrome extension in order to provide the data I am looking for.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend testing EverBee for yourself to see whether it works for you in the running of your Etsy business.</p>
<p>They’ve just launched a new Etsy Email tool that helps send professional-looking emails and build an Etsy Email List.</p>

<h2 id="everbee-vs-erank" class="wp-block-heading">EverBee vs eRank</h2>
<p>When it comes to optimizing your Etsy shop for better visibility and sales, erank vs EverBee is a common question as they are two of the most popular tools that come to mind. While both tools are designed to help Etsy sellers improve their listings and increase traffic, they take different approaches.</p>
<p>EverBee has a wider set of functionality built around its Chrome extension that offers a wide range of features such as keyword research, listing analysis, and product ideas.</p>
<p>By providing estimated sales data EverBee aims to help direct your next best-selling product.</p>
<p>Both EverBee and eRank offer free plans, however, a paid plan is required to benefit from all key functionality.</p>
<p>eRank is a more comprehensive Keyword research tool for Etsy SEO and focuses more on SEO and search data, listing analysis, trend tracking, and competitor research. </p>
<p>Erank doesn’t provide all the additional shop management features that Everbee does.</p>
<p>Both are solid tools. Which you should choose depends on what you need a tool for.</p>
<p>Following its recent update, I think Everbee provides everything an etsy seller needs and removes the need of a dedicated keyword research tool.</p>
<h2 id="everbee-vs-alura" class="wp-block-heading">EverBee vs Alura</h2>
<p>These two tools have similarities at their core. They both have Chrome extensions and show estimated sales data as one of their main selling points.</p>
<p>However, as shown by the tests above, Everbee data is more accurate and with the addition of Everbee email, Everbee would be my choice out of the two.</p>
<h2 id="everbee-vs-marmalead" class="wp-block-heading">EverBee VS Marmalead</h2>
<p>Comparing EverBee to Marmalead is very similar to comparing EverBee to eRank. Both are solid tools but serve slightly different purposes.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing between EverBee vs Marmalead, it is important to assess which tool is right for your Etsy shop’s needs. If you just want keyword research, then Marmalead may be better.</p>
<p>If you want a wider set of features to help you manage your shop as well as research products, shops, lists and more, then Everbee is the better tool.</p>
<h2 id="everbee-review--the-verdict" class="wp-block-heading">EverBee Review – The Verdict</h2>
<p>Since the upgrade Everbee has become my go to tool.</p>
<p>The estimated sales data is pretty accurate and will help you find new products to sell and help you grow your etsy business by getting more Etsy sales.</p>
<p>Everbee has all the features Alura has with the addition of more accurate data AND everbee email. Don’t underestimate how important having an email list is. Everbee makes this super simple to implement and manage.</p>
